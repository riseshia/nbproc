# nbproc

Expose ruby internal C API which create proc with **n**o **b**inding.
This gem aims to let user access easier to Ractor,
since normal proc isn't shareable.

## Installation

    $ bundle add nbproc

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install nbproc

## Usage

```ruby
some_proc = proc { 1 }.isolate
some_proc = nbproc { 1 } # which is syntax sugar of above.

Ractor.shareable?(some_proc) # => true
```

## Development
